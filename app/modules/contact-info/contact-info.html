        <p>
        	Hello, my name is Taylor!
			I am new to town, and am living in the Seattle, Washington area. I'm attending Brigham Young University and will be graduating with my degree in Photography. Woo hoo!
			<br><br>
			I married the man of my dreams two years ago, and have been busy living out the "happily ever after" portion of my fairytale since. I am a mother to a beautiful boy in Heaven, whose name is Eden, and am excitedly expecting my second little guy as well! I love nature, animals, and books... as well as an adventure or two for photography's sake! ;)
